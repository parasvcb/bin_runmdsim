trying merging all the preliminary steps during equilibrations
production modules are pending, with detailed automation and no accidental log file re writing
common function to run and remove tcl scripts is also pending 
and detailed functionalities is missing with appropeiate data mixing

composed with cronjobkiller for smd
#*/10 * * * * ~/miniconda3/bin/python ~/bin/cronjobkiller.py >> /tmp/cronjoblogs.log
above is the crontab automator

Likely cronjobkiller needs arguemnets for /tmp and plots location
further onctrsin the functions and see if classes and objects for analysis can be supplemented

make sure while changing module runit, add timeout prior exiting, if error and timeout exceeding 10 mins, have a relook and skip , else start looping down ,
till comfortable number of parallelizable cores are fit in, else afer 1 node, it wont run, severly looking for manual manipulations
